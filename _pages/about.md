<h5>We tend to forget what we learn…</h5>

<p>Once I developed an interest in Elasticsearch it was hard for me to keep updated on the latest trends. Also, as I lost touch I kept on forgetting the technology.</p> 

<h5>We have the passion…</h5>

<p>To learn, but we tend to procrastinate because it takes a lot of decision power to find an article to read.</p> 

<p>I’ve had the pleasure of working with cloud technologies for the past 6 years. I am writing this blog to challenge my knowledge by simplistically teaching you the cloud.</p>

<h5>I'm Amroj Sandhu...</h5>

<p>Easing your pain to keep updated with the cloud trends. Setting up an easy tone to all the articles so that we understand the basics.</p>

<p>I like to talk about early retirement, tiny houses, CrossFit, and cycling.</p>
